ðŸ“Œ**Model Training**

To train the machine learning models, run the Jupyter Notebook _Dementia_model_training.ipynb_. This notebook covers loading the dataset, exploring data, training models, and hyperparameter tuning.

ðŸ“Œ**Model Prediction**

To make predictions using the trained models, run the Python script _Dementia_prediction_model.py_. This script loads the models, takes user input through a Streamlit app, and displays predictions.

ðŸ“Œ**Streamlit App**

The Streamlit app simplifies user interaction with the trained models. Users can input their health-related information, and the app will provide predictions based on the trained models.
